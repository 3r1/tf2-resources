wip, will add more maps over time

Overheads merged and edited in gimp from screenshots taken in tf2

how can you do this for other maps?
    1. load map in tf2
    2. use commands:
        cl_drawhud 0
        noclip
            to move around more easily
        cl_leveloverview 0-10+
            0 sets view back to normal game view
            generally you want 2 or 3
            if you use 1 you will have to take many, many images and merge them
    3. take a screenshot
    4. do a bunch of editing

files:
    6s_positions folder
        hold/push class positions/strategies
    map folders
        top-down images of individual capture points and full map
