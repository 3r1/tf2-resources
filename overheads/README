wip, will add more maps over time

Overheads merged and edited in gimp from screenshots taken in tf2

how can you do this for other maps?
    1. load map in tf2
    2. use commands:
        cl_drawhud 0
        noclip
            to move around more easily
        cl_leveloverview 0-10+
            0 sets view back to normal game view
            generally you'll want to use 2 or 3
    3. take a screenshot
    4. do a bunch of editing
    ?. this is a huge hassle, things clip, certain stuff overlays, what the heck?
        yep: your vertical position + the vertical camera position above you determines what is seen
            consequently, you may also experience the camera being above the skybox
                to fix that, try looking straight down or up before using the cl_leveloverview command 
                    then, use W and S to adjust your vertical position until you have a good view
            additionally, try to also align yourself on one of the other two axes so that you can use A and D to move along it

files:
    6s_positions folder
        hold/push class positions/strategies
    map folders
        top-down images of individual capture points and full map
