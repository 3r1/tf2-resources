move-rename-demos.py
    demo processing credit to demopan (https://github.com/vixus0/demopan)

    this script is a vast simplification and small upgrade of demopan because
      ds_record saves demo files with datetime as name and also allows for
      use of ds_mark markers and automatic scoreboard screenshots
    this removes the requirement of having demopan running alongside tf2
      consequently, this script can be run at any time to pull demos from tf2 at
      your leisure
    this script also renames scoreboard screenshots and ds_mark marker files
      scoreboard images are automatically created when ds_stop is called)
    you will have to link the event file in tf/demos/ created by ds_record 
      manually as I feel it's silly to copy/overrite or diffcheck+append

    What it do tho?
    For use with ds_record and ds_mark. Moves and renames .dem, .json, and .tga
      appending mapname, playername

    example usage:
    python3 move-rename-demos.py -i '/home/USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/demos/' -o '/home/USER/Videos/tf2/demos/'

    example input files created by ds_record:
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.dem
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.tga
    example output file after running this python script:
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-cp_snakewater_final1-USERNAME.dem
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-cp_snakewater_final1-USERNAME.json
      YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-cp_snakewater_final1-USERNAME.tga

    consider making an alias in bashrc
    alias tf2demo "python3 /home/USER/Videos/tf2/move-rename-demos.py -i '/home/USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/demos/' -o '/home/USER/Videos/tf2/demos/'"

    example autoexec.cfg alias for demo recording and markers in case you're lost
      alias demo_record_on "say_team Recording...; ds_record; alias demo_record demo_record_off"
      alias demo_record_off "say_team Stopping recording; ds_stop; alias demo_record demo_record_on"
      alias demo_record "demo_record_on"
      bind "f8" "demo_record"

      alias demo_mark_epic "ds_mark something_epic_may_have_occured"
      bind "f9" "demo_mark_epic"
