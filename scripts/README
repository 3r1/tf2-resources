move-rename-demos.py
    demo processing credit to demopan (https://github.com/vixus0/demopan)

    this script is a vast simplification of demopan because ds_record saves demo
      files with datetime as name
    this removes the requirement of having demopan running alongside tf2
      consequently, this script can be run at any time to pull demos from tf2 at
      your leisure
    this also allows us to have scoreboard screenshots and ds_mark markers
        (scoreboard images are automatically created when ds_stop is called)
    you will have to link the event file in tf/demos/ created by ds_record 
      manually as I feel it's silly to copy/overrite or diffcheck+append

    What it do tho?
    For use with ds_record and ds_mark. Moves and renames .dem, .json, and .tga
      appending mapname, playername

    example usage:
    python3 /home/USER/Videos/tf2/move-rename-demos.py -i '/home/USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/demos/' -o '/home/USER/Videos/tf2/demos/'

    consider making an alias
    alias tf2demo "python3 /home/USER/Videos/tf2/move-rename-demos.py -i '/home/USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/demos/' -o '/home/USER/Videos/tf2/demos/'"
